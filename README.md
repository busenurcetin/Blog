## Getting Started

Welcome to the blog. I made it by using CSS,NodeJS, ExpressJS, JavaScript and MongoDB. Plus used Ckeditor in blog on share post page. There is still alot to develop on front-end and back-end I may develop it in the future but for now its done. After million errors i am too happy to share it with you. Do not forget to add depenenicies(compass, ejs,express,express-session,mongodb,mongoose,passport,passport-local,passport-local-mongoose) on your computer.
